# Rising Water/Lava (MC-RisingLiquid)
A Minecraft datapack that raises water or lava levels over time.

## How to play:
1. Install the datapack.
2. Reload the server or world.
3. Run `/trigger rising-book`
4. Use the book to set up the rest.

Because of how Minecraft commands work, there's currently a worldborder to prevent players from leaving the area that will be filled.

## Setting explanations:
| Setting         | Details     | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Change Mode** | Sets the mode to `Water` or `Lava`. This picks the fluid that will be rising. | **Changing this setting mid-game may have unintended side effects.** |
| **Set Height**  | Changes the height of the fluid. This specifies the layer that will be filled next, but doesn't fill layers below it. | Be sure to click the prompt in chat. |
| **Set Delay**   | The time, in seconds, it takes for the fluid to rise by one block. | Be sure to click the prompt in chat. |
| **Permadeath**  | On or Off. Self-explanatory. | If changed mid-game, players who have died may need to be put back into Survival mode. |
| **Start/Stop**  | Self-explanatory. | Found on page 2. |
